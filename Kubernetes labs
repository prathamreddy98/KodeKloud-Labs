## PODS with YAML Lab:

How many pods exist on the system?
ANS: Kubectl get pods

Create a new pod with the nginx image.
ANS: kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

What is the image used to create the new pods?You must look at one of the new pods in detail to figure this out.
ANS: kubectl describe pod newpods-r5hdc

Which nodes are these pods placed on?You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.
ANS: kubectl describe pod newpods-r5hdc and look for “Node”

How many containers are part of the pod webapp?
ANS:  kuebctl describe pod webapp

Why do you think the container agentx in pod webapp is in error?
ANS:  A Docker image with this name doesn't exist on Docker Hub

What does the READY column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicate?

Create a new pod with the name redis and the image redis123.Use a pod-definition YAML file. And yes the image name is wrong!
ANS:  first step is to run file with dry run of yaml to create a manifest file. kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-definition.yaml

To create a resource from the manifest file:
kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml


Now change the image on this pod to redis.
First delete the running pod by using kubectl delete pod [pod name, here redis]
Then in the above command change the image name and re run the commands
