What is the flavor and version of Operating System on which the Kubernetes nodes are running?
ANS: Command is kubectl get nodes -o wide

There is a yaml file named practice.yaml under /home/bob/playbooks/ directory with a key property1 and value value1.Add an additional key named property2 and value value2.
ANS:
property1: value1
property2:  value2

We have updated the /home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml file with the key name and value apple. Add some additional properties (given below) to the dictionary.
ANS:
name= apple
color= red
weight= 90g
ANS- name: apple
color: red
weight: 90

We have updated the /home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml file with a dictionary named employee. Add the remaining properties to it using information from the table below.
ANS:
employee:
  name: john
  gender: male
  age: 24

Now, update the /home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml file with a dictionary in dictionary.
ANS: employee:
  name: john
  gender: male
  age: 24
  address:
   city: edison
   state: new jersey
   country: united states

We have updated the /home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml file with some data for apple, orange and mango. Just like apple, we would like to add additional details for each item, such as color, weight etc. Modify the remaining items to match the below data.
ANS: - name: apple
  color: red
  weight: 100g
- name: orange
  color: orange
  weight: 90g
- name: mango
  color: yellow
  weight: 150g

We have updated the /home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml file with a dictionary named employee. We would like to record information about multiple employees. Convert the dictionary named employee to an array named employees
ANS: employees:
  	  - name: john
    	   gender: male
    	   age: 24

Update the /home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml file to add an additional employee (below the existing entry) to the list using the below information.
ANS: employees:
 	 - name: john
    	  gender: male
    	  age: 24
  	- name: sarah
      	 gender: female
      	 age: 28
## PODS with YAML Lab:

How many pods exist on the system?
ANS: Kubectl get pods

Create a new pod with the nginx image.
ANS: kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

What is the image used to create the new pods?You must look at one of the new pods in detail to figure this out.
ANS: kubectl describe pod newpods-r5hdc

Which nodes are these pods placed on?You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.
ANS: kubectl describe pod newpods-r5hdc and look for “Node”

How many containers are part of the pod webapp?
ANS:  kuebctl describe pod webapp

Why do you think the container agentx in pod webapp is in error?
ANS:  A Docker image with this name doesn't exist on Docker Hub

What does the READY column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicate?
ANS: Running container in Pods/ Total container
 
Create a new pod with the name redis and the image redis123.Use a pod-definition YAML file. And yes the image name is wrong!
ANS:  first step is to run file with dry run of yaml to create a manifest file. kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-definition.yaml

To create a resource from the manifest file:
kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml


Now change the image on this pod to redis.
First delete the running pod by using kubectl delete pod [pod name, here redis]
Then in the above command change the image name and re run the commands

## REPLICA SET LABS

How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
ANS: kubectl get replicaset

What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?
ANS: kubectl describe replicaset

How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?
ANS: kubectl get replicaset and look for “READY” column

Why do you think the PODs are not ready?
ANS: kubectl describe pods

Delete any one of the 4 PODs.
ANS: kubectl delete pod new-replica-set-s7c28

Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.
There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.
ANS: change the API version to apps/v1 . We can debug it using kubect explain replicaset

Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.
ANS: Change the value of tier in matchLables section to nginx to match it with label name under the template section

Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2
ANS: kubectl delete replicaset replicaset-2

Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.
ANS: kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set

Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs.
ANS: kubectl scale replicaset new-replica-set  --replicas=5



Deployment labs

How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
ANS:  kubectl get replicaset

How many Deployments exist on the system?
ANS: kubectl get deployment

How many Deployments exist on the system now?
ANS:   kubectl get deployment and count number of deployments under the “NAME” section

Out of all the existing PODs, how many are ready?
ANS: kubectl get deployment and count number of ready pods

What is the image used to create the pods in the new deployment?
ANS: kubectl describe deployment and search the Pod Template section

Why do you think the deployment is not ready?
ANS: kubectl describe pods

Updates and rollback labs:

What is the current color of the web application?
ANS: Blue

Inspect the deployment and identify the number of PODs deployed by it
ANS: kubectl get pods or kubectl describe deployment and look for desired replicas

What container image is used to deploy the applications?
ANS:  kubectl describe deployment

Inspect the deployment and identify the current strategy
ANS: kubectl describe deployment and look for “strategy” section 


Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
ANS:  kubectl edit deployment. Opens the file in vi editor
